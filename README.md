X-Wing Shooter Game (Unity DOTS)
Overview
This is a 2D space shooter where you control an X-Wing and shoot incoming targets. Originally intended as Tie Fighters, the targets had to be simplified due to time constraints. The game uses Unityâ€™s Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) for high performance and scalability.

Installation
Clone the repo.
Open the project in Unity.
Press Play to start.


Performance Optimization
ECS (Entity Component System)
Used for handling large numbers of entities (enemies, bullets) efficiently by separating data from behavior, which improves performance through better memory usage and chunking.

Burst Compiler
Optimized CPU-heavy calculations, improving execution speed and reducing overhead.

Challenges
Learning DOTS was difficult due to its unique structure compared to traditional Unity.
Time constraints and illness limited the scope (e.g., Tie Fighters were simplified).

Future Improvements
Add animated Tie Fighters.
Introduce enemy behaviors and power-ups.
Further optimize collision detection.

How to Play
Use arrow keys/WASD to move.
Press LeftMouse to shoot.
Avoid enemy collisions!
